<h2>A Fun Place to Work !!!<h2>
  <p>
    As we are nearing to our first Janova Annual Party</br>
    As evrybody I am also highly excited,</br>
    we all know that in the party we are given </br>
    three tickets to get our favorite drinks </br> </br> </br>
    But as we all know three is never enough for us, so a</br> 
    small idea kicked up there are friends in our company </br>
    who don't drink, lets get their tickets but how? I decided </br>
    that we will collect all tickets and ask people to bid for them</br>
    How does that sound???</br>
  </p>
  <h5>Please, take it this in fun spirit, it is intended</br>
  All the money goes to charity</h5>
